# My assumptions

### How to execute the program

It just needs to be run in a text editor with a console, and the output will appear there.

### Assumptions that I made
* When a player selects 'q', they don't need to be asked if they are sure they meant to do that, since the input 'q' is quite different to co-ordinates
* Anything aside from 'q' and the co-ordinates in 'places' are considered incorrect
